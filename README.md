# 2048-Game
Hello Everyone!! 
I am Divit, i have made this project in my 5th semester for my college projects!! hope you like this interative game.
The main aim of this project is to build a 2048 game using python in GUI. This is a simple 2048 game in python programming.
Here I have use the tkinter python library for creating a graphical user interface that is a GUI and also we have to import random python module.
This game includes a single player. The game starts with only two tiles and the lowest number tile is two, then player have to combine the titles and make a high numbers tile.
Once you got 2048 in any row you won the game and the player lost the game which means that every tile on the board is occupied and there are no possible moves left.
So the game is over.
